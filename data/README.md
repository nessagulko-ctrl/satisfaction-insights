## Dataset

This project uses a cleaned sample from the U.S. Department of Education College Scorecard dataset.

The dataset includes institutional characteristics such as:
- Institution name and location
- Public vs. private control
- Predominant degree type offered
- Geographic region

The dataset has been reduced to a manageable sample to allow for exploratory analysis and pattern detection.
