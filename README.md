# Satisfaction Insights

An exploratory data analysis project examining how institutional characteristics are associated with different higher-education pathways in the United States.

Rather than measuring subjective satisfaction, this project focuses on **structural indicators** that shape long-term educational investment and opportunity.

## Project Focus

This project explores the question:

**What institutional characteristics are associated with higher-investment educational pathways in U.S. colleges and universities?**

In this analysis, *higher-investment pathways* are operationalized as institutions that predominantly grant bachelor’s degrees, compared to those focused on associate or certificate programs.

---

## Dataset Overview

The analysis uses a cleaned sample from the U.S. Department of Education’s College Scorecard dataset.  
Each row represents a higher-education institution, with the following key attributes:

- **Institution Name**
- **City & State**
- **Institutional Control** (Public, Private nonprofit, Private for-profit)
- **Predominant Degree Type** (Certificate, Associate, Bachelor’s)
- **Geographic Region**

The dataset focuses on institutional structure rather than student-level outcomes.

## Analytical Approach

The analysis examines how structural factors—such as institutional control and regional context—are associated with the type of degree pathways institutions offer.

Key comparisons include:
- Public vs. private nonprofit vs. for-profit institutions
- Bachelor’s-degree–granting institutions vs. certificate and associate-focused institutions
- Regional clustering of degree pathways across the U.S.

The goal is to identify **patterns and trade-offs** in how educational opportunity is structured at the institutional level.

## What This Project Is (and Is Not)

**This project does:**
- Analyze real-world institutional data
- Identify structural patterns in higher-education pathways
- Focus on systems, trade-offs, and long-term investment signals

**This project does not:**
- Measure student satisfaction directly
- Make causal claims about outcomes like earnings or happiness

All conclusions are framed as **associations**, not causal effects.

## Project Status

This project is a work in progress.  
Next steps include:
- Aggregating degree pathways by institutional control
- Visualizing regional distributions of degree types
- Summarizing key structural patterns and insights
