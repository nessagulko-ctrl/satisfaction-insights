# Satisfaction Insights

An analytical project exploring patterns associated with high-satisfaction outcomes in university choices.

# Project Question

This project explores the question:

**What distinguishes high-satisfaction outcomes from average ones in university choices?**

The goal is to analyze real-world data and extract patterns, comparisons,
and insights that help explain what factors are most strongly associated
with better outcomes.

The focus is on analytical reasoning and decision-making, rather than
subjective opinion, using data to understand what actually matters.
